Hi, I’m @nykolai-d. I am a humanist gone bad. When I was younger, I studied and exercised History and Languages (Spanish, French, English). 
Now I am studying an undergraduate program in Mathematics. I am currently in seventh semester. 
I am learning data science and in the process of migrating my line of work in that direction.
I’m currently learning Python, R, Machine Learning and Statistics. Also, I am delving into many pure Maths concepts which are beautiful, but still don't know exactly how to apply them anywhere (the complex plain and the Riemann Sphere, for example).
I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could help me get better in data science.
Feel free to reach me anytime through my email: ndiazdurana@gmail.com
