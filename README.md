Hi, I’m Nicolas Diaz-Durana. I am a Mathematician with studies and extensive professional experience in linguistics. I’m fluent in Python, and am deeply interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, as well as Statistics and data-driven analysis.

Some Python libraries that I feel confortable with are NLTK, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Sympy, Scikit-Learn and TextBlob. I know my way around R, Java and SQL.

Here, you will find works that I have developed in Python, R and LaTeX, the latter focusing on some advanced math and physics topics. I'm into projects that can potentially integrate diverse domains of knowledge. I speak, read and write in English, Spanish and French.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that tackles with real-life data-driven problems, especially (but not limited to) Natural Language Processing.
Feel free to contact me anytime through my email: ndiazdurana@gmail.com
