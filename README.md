Hi, I’m Nicolas Diaz-Durana. I am a Mathematician with studies and vast professional experience in Psychology, History and Music. I’m fluent in Python, and am deeply interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, as well as Statistics and data-driven analysis. 

Some Python libraries that I am comforatble with are NLTK, TextBlob, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, IPython, Matplotlib, Sympy, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. 

Here, you will find works that I have developed in Python, Java and LaTeX, the latter focusing on some advanced math and physics topícs. I am into projects that can potentially integrate seemingly distant domains of knowledge. I speak, read and write in English, Spanish and French. I'm a native Spanish speaker, but think mostly in English.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that tackles with real-life data-driven problems, especially (but not limited to) Natural Language Processing.
Feel free to reach me anytime through my email: ndiazdurana@gmail.com
